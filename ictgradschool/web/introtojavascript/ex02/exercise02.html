                <p>The DOM models an HTML page as a tree structure.</p>

                <p>Every component of your HTML page is modelled as a <i>node</i> in the DOM tree.</p>

                <p>Warning: attributes are no longer going to inherit methods from Node in the DOM4 specification. Refer
                    to
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attr"> MDN The Attr
                        Object</a>.
                    But that's in the future. At present attributes are still Nodes, even if calling Node methods on an
                    attribute makes little sense.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="text2">
                <p>For each Node in the DOM tree, particularly nodes that are <i>elements</i>, you will want want to
                    think about
                    what node is its parent, whether it has any siblings, and any children.</p>

                <p>Knowing these relationships can let you navigate from one Node to another in an HTML page, starting
                    at the
                    document node.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="text3">
                <p>You'll be trying that in the next exercise. For this exercise, you will need to understand the
                    interrelationships between the pieces of HTML content on this page: elements, text nodes, and
                    anything else
                    starting at the document level.</p>

                <p>Note how the tabbing on this page helps you to see relationships and the tree hierarchy better (when
                    you view
                    the source on this HTML page).</p>
